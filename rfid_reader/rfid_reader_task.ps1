# Name:
#	rfid_reader_task.ps1
# By:
#	Peter Wolfe, wolfe@pobox.com
#
# Description:
#	Task script to be executed by the Windows Task Scheduler
#   to generate an attendance report every night at midnight. 
#   Google sync will move that up the frc2590attendance google drive
#   for use with the attendance spreadsheet that crunches the numbers.
#   The latest report is always in sync\current.csv. We rename that to
#	current_<date>.csv to make way for the new report. 
#
#   Note: Do not be fooled. Stupid Windows Task Schedule shows this task as "Running"
#   even after it's complete (when testing manually). If you just refresh the window will show "Ready" properly.       
#
# Assumptions:
#	Assume that the main rfid_driver.ps1 script is in the system PATH
#   (so we don't have to hardcode a path here...)
#
# Usage:
#   Run the Windows Task Schedule app and create a basic task
#   Trigger is daily
#   Start is  12:00AM on the first day of build season, recur every 1 day
#   Action is Start a program
#   Program script (powershell )
#       Add arguments: -noprofile -executionpolicy bypass -file <path>\rfid_reader_task.ps1
#       Start in: the directory where rfid_reader_task.ps1 installed 
#       (same dir where rfid_reader.ps1)
#   Choose to open additional options (task properties)
#       Run when user is logged on or not
#
